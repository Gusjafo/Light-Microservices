# üß© Microservices Demo (.NET + SQLite)

This project is a **learning-oriented microservices architecture** built with **ASP.NET Core Web API** and **Entity Framework Core (SQLite)**.  

The goal is to understand the basics of microservices step by step:  
- Independent services  
- Database per service  
- Communication between services  
- Resilience & containerization (later with Docker)

---

## üìö What are Microservices?

- **Microservice** = a small, independent application that does *one thing well*.  
- Each service:  
  - Has its own codebase  
  - Runs independently  
  - Owns its own database  
  - Talks to others via APIs  

### Monolith vs Microservices

| Monolith üèõ | Microservices üß© |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Single codebase, tightly coupled | Many small, independent services |
| One shared database | One database per service |
| Easy to start, harder to scale | More complex, but scalable & resilient |

## üèóÔ∏è Services in this Project

We simulate a **mini e-commerce system** with 4 services:

- **User Service** ‚Üí manages users (`users.db`)
- **Product Service** ‚Üí manages products (`products.db`)
- **Order Service** ‚Üí manages orders (`orders.db`), validates users and products
- **EventHub Service** ‚Üí listens to RabbitMQ events and streams them to the UI via SignalR

---

## üìÇ Solution Structure

```
MicroservicesDemo.sln
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService/          # Manages users
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProductService/       # Manages products
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OrderService/         # Manages orders
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EventHubService/      # SignalR hub that replays domain events for the UI
```

Each service is:
- An **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- Uses **EF Core + SQLite**
- Has its own **database file**
- Runs on its own port

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Services

Open a terminal for each service and run:

```bash
# User Service (http://localhost:5001)
cd UserService
dotnet run

# Product Service (http://localhost:5003)
cd ProductService
dotnet run

# Order Service (http://localhost:5005)
cd OrderService
dotnet run

# EventHub Service (http://localhost:5007)
cd EventHubService
dotnet run
```

### üê≥ Running with Docker Compose

To start all services together with persistent SQLite databases, use Docker Compose from the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Database files are stored on the host inside the `data/` directory (one subfolder per service), so they survive container restarts.

The EventHub service is also available at `http://localhost:5007` and exposes the SignalR hub at `/hub/notifications` for Angular clients.

> **RabbitMQ Dashboard** ‚Äî Once Compose is running, open http://localhost:15672 (default user/password: `guest`/`guest`) to inspect queues, messages, and consumers that MassTransit creates.

### üêá RabbitMQ & MassTransit Setup

- Docker Compose spins up a dedicated `rabbitmq:3-management` container alongside the APIs.
- `UserService` now emits a `UserCreatedEvent` whenever a new profile is stored.
- `OrderService` publishes either `OrderCreatedEvent` (success) or `OrderFailedEvent` (e.g. insufficient stock) to orchestrate downstream workflows.
- `ProductService` listens for `OrderCreatedEvent`, applies **idempotent** stock updates, and emits a `StockDecreasedEvent` once the inventory change succeeds.
- Connection settings can be overridden via `RabbitMq__*` environment variables (see `appsettings.Development.json` for local defaults).

---

## üîé Endpoints

### üë§ User Service
- `GET /api/users` ‚Üí list users
- `GET /api/users/{id}` ‚Üí get user by ID
- `POST /api/users` ‚Üí create a user
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` ‚Üí update name/email
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` ‚Üí remove a user
- `GET /api/logs/{level}` ‚Üí inspect `logs/{level}.log` (`info`, `warning`, `error`)

Example request:
```json
{ "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }
```

---

### üì¶ Product Service
- `GET /api/products` ‚Üí list products
- `GET /api/products/{id}` ‚Üí get product by ID
- `POST /api/products` ‚Üí create a product
- `PUT /api/products/{id}` ‚Üí update product details
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}` ‚Üí remove a product
- `GET /api/logs/{level}` ‚Üí inspect `logs/{level}.log`

Example request:
```json
{ "name": "Laptop", "price": 1200.00, "stock": 5 }
```

---

### üìù Order Service
- `GET /api/orders` ‚Üí list the most recent orders
- `GET /api/orders/{id}` ‚Üí get order by ID
- `POST /api/orders` ‚Üí create a new order
- `GET /api/logs/{level}` ‚Üí inspect `logs/{level}.log`

### üîî EventHub Service
- `SignalR hub` ‚Üí connect clients to `/hub/notifications`
- Broadcasts: `OrderCreated`, `StockDecreased`, `OrderFailed`, `UserCreated`
- `GET /api/logs/{level}` ‚Üí inspect `logs/{level}.log`

Example request:
```json
{ "userId": "GUID", "productId": "GUID", "quantity": 2 }
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Orders are created synchronously over HTTP. After persistence the service publishes an `OrderCreatedEvent`, which triggers Product Service to adjust inventory.

---

## üìä Architecture (Step 1)

```mermaid
graph TD
  U[User Service] -->|manages users| DB1[(users.db)]
  P[Product Service] -->|manages products| DB2[(products.db)]
  O[Order Service] -->|manages orders| DB3[(orders.db)]
```

---

## üìå Step 2: Service Communication (REST)

The **Order Service** now orchestrates synchronous validations via **REST APIs**:

- ‚úÖ Checks the user exists in User Service
- ‚úÖ Fetches product details & stock from Product Service
- ‚úÖ Uses Polly policies (retry & circuit breaker) for resilience when calling external APIs

## üöÄ Step 3: Advanced Events, Idempotency & Observability

- ‚úÖ **Event catalog expanded** ‚Üí `UserCreatedEvent`, `OrderCreatedEvent`, `OrderFailedEvent`, and `StockDecreasedEvent` flow through RabbitMQ.
- ‚úÖ **Event IDs & deduplication** ‚Üí every message carries an `EventId`; each service persists processed IDs to a dedicated `ProcessedEvents` table before acting, so re-delivery is safe.
- ‚úÖ **Serilog observability** ‚Üí all services write structured logs to `logs/info.log`, `logs/warnings.log`, and `logs/errors.log` while still streaming to the console and exposing them via `GET /api/logs/{level}`.
- üîÑ **Idempotent consumers** ‚Üí Product Service checks the `ProcessedEvents` table before decreasing stock, preventing accidental double decrements.

## üöÄ Step 4: Event-Driven Choreography

To remove tight coupling after an order is placed we introduced RabbitMQ + MassTransit:

1. User API persists data and emits `UserCreatedEvent` so other services (e.g. newsletters) can react asynchronously.
2. Order API saves the order (or rejects it) and publishes either `OrderCreatedEvent` or `OrderFailedEvent` with descriptive reasons.
3. Product Service consumes order events, decrements inventory exactly once, and broadcasts `StockDecreasedEvent` for downstream systems (analytics, search, etc.).
4. RabbitMQ keeps a durable queue so no order events are lost if Product Service is offline temporarily.
5. You can watch the message flow via the management UI at http://localhost:15672.

## üöÄ Step 6: Angular-ready Backend

- ‚úÖ **CORS policy** ‚Üí every microservice shares the `AllowAngular` policy so `http://localhost:4200` can call REST endpoints and SignalR without browser errors.
- ‚úÖ **CRUD-friendly APIs** ‚Üí User and Product services expose full CRUD at `/api/users` and `/api/products`; Order service adds list + detail endpoints at `/api/orders`.
- ‚úÖ **EventHub service** ‚Üí subscribes to `UserCreatedEvent`, `OrderCreatedEvent`, `StockDecreasedEvent`, and `OrderFailedEvent` via MassTransit and broadcasts them to Angular clients over SignalR.
- ‚úÖ **Log streaming** ‚Üí each service offers `GET /api/logs/{level}` to surface `info`, `warning`, or `error` logs generated by Serilog.

### Future Topics
- API Gateway (single entry point)
- Additional asynchronous workflows (refunds, restocking, etc.)
- Docker & Docker Compose optimisations
- Deployment to cloud

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

- **.gitignore** excludes build artifacts, local DBs, and IDE files.  
- Local databases (`*.db`) are not committed ‚Üí each developer has their own local test data.  
- Each service is isolated ‚Üí can be scaled, deployed, or rebuilt independently.  

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Test Flow

1. **Create a user**  
   ```http
   POST http://localhost:5001/api/users
   Content-Type: application/json

   { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }
   ```

2. **Create a product**  
   ```http
   POST http://localhost:5003/api/products
   Content-Type: application/json

   { "name": "Laptop", "price": 1200.00, "stock": 5 }
   ```

3. **Create an order**
   Use the `userId` and `productId` from the responses above:

   ```http
   POST http://localhost:5005/api/orders
   Content-Type: application/json

   { "userId": "GUID", "productId": "GUID", "quantity": 2 }
   ```

4. **Verify stock was decremented asynchronously**
   ```http
   GET http://localhost:5003/api/products/{productId}
   ```
   The `stock` value should be reduced by the ordered quantity once the message is processed.

5. **Simulate an insufficient stock order**
   - Reuse the same product but request a quantity greater than the remaining stock.
   - Order Service returns HTTP 400 and publishes an `OrderFailedEvent` with the detailed reason.

6. **Validate idempotency**
   - In RabbitMQ's management UI, use the **Publish message** tab on the `order-created` queue to resend the previously processed payload **with the original `eventId`**.
   - Product Service will detect the duplicate in `ProcessedEvents` and skip the stock change, logging the decision at `Information` level.

7. **Inspect RabbitMQ & logs (optional)**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:15672 and login with `guest` / `guest` to observe exchanges, queues, and message counters.
   - Check each service's `Logs/` folder for `info.log`, `warnings.log`, and `errors.log` to see the Serilog outputs for the steps above.
